# coesite3
vector tile server (onyx with Azure AD authentication) in development environment.  
Please be advised that this repository is for a specific environment. Not for general use.

Compared with un-vector-tile-toolkit/coesite, this repository has following characters:
1. npm modules are updated.  
2. ESRI interface has been added. (see unvt/marble to check how it works)  
3. mysql is used for the session store.  
4. Some functions, such as raster drawing test and story-telling, are removed to make the structure simple.
